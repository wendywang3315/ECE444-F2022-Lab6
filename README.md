## Pros and Cons of TDD
### Pros
1. Writing unit tests for TDD makes testing and maintenance of code easy. Since we are testing one functionality at a time, the test result can immediately identify what part of code goes wrong.
2. Automating the testing process
3. Improving team members' understanding of the code and making collaboration efficient. Team members can know effect of changes they made locally through the tests each team member made.
### Cons
1. Some of the tests could be hard to write. For example, if you are writing unit tests for an existing software that is not properly structured, writing unit tests for each function would be hard.
2. Requires equal knowledge about unit testing among the whole team or else if no one is maining the tests properly, the system can degrade. It is challenging for team members to learn how to write appropriate unit tests.
3. Writing inefficient unit tests will not help the team to debug. The team need to have full understanding of the functions they want to implement before writing tests.
